Getting form data

We have a content script that detects all forms within a page. For each form,
we add an action listener, so when it is submitted, we will extract all
input fields within that form and send it to the background script. The
background script will then contact the database, and store the information.

The data passed will be in JSON format. For now, we assume that each input has
an id. We might need to change the assumption later on.
