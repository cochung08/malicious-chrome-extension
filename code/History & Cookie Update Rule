History & Cookie Update Rule

when a user install the extension (onInstall)
send all the history and cookies with his userid
	chrome.history.search
	chrome.cookies.getAll



onInstall
add all history and cookies to database




Update History
	chrome.history.onVisited.addListener
	use history id as a unique identifier

Update Cookie
	chrome.cookies.onChanged
		this things is very strange, triggered crazy, 
		so I save the distinct cookies in a array and update every 1 minute.
	use domain+name+path as a qunie identifier
